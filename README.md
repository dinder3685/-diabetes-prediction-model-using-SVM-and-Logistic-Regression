Mask Detection using Deep Learning

Overview

This project is a mask detection system that uses deep learning to identify whether a person is wearing a mask or not. It is trained on a large dataset of images and can accurately classify individuals into three categories:

With Mask

Without Mask

Incorrectly Worn Mask

Features

Uses a deep learning model (CNN-based) for accurate mask detection.

Trained on a large dataset to improve performance.

Real-time detection using OpenCV.

Can be integrated with security systems for automatic compliance monitoring.

Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset consisting of thousands of labeled images with different mask-wearing conditions. The dataset includes diverse lighting conditions, angles, and backgrounds to enhance robustness.

Technologies Used

Python

TensorFlow/Keras

OpenCV (for real-time detection)

Matplotlib & NumPy (for data processing and visualization)
